C++ game based on the Dungeon Crawler Carl Series by Matt Dinniman

<h3>Things to research:</h3>

<ol>Which 2D library to use</ol>
<ol>How to move an object around a screen</ol>

I feel like the fundementals are very similar to Javascript, wondering if I should keep using codedex or just try jump in.

I got a copy of<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/en-us/product/sfml-game-development-by-example-9781785287343" target="_blank">

I saw a TikTok yesterday of some dude saying there's no point in learning C++. I'm not sure why I chose to understand it. Just struck out as interesting.

<h3>✅ Pros of C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>High performance and fast execution</li>
    <li>Fine control over memory and system resources</li>
    <li>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) support</li>
    <li>Rich Standard Template Library (STL)</li>
    <li>Cross-platform compatibility</li>
    <li>Mature language with lots of community support</li>
    <li>Compatible with C code and libraries</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>❌ Cons of C++</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Steep learning curve and complex syntax</li>
    <li>Manual memory management (risk of memory leaks, bugs)</li>
    <li>Lack of built-in safety features (e.g., garbage collection)</li>
    <li>Longer compile times</li>
    <li>Poor support for GUI/web out of the box</li>
    <li>Difficult debugging, especially with pointers/templates</li>
  </ul>

It's funny how working towards a project that generally interests you is far more exhilarating than one that doesn't. Today, I did some more fundamental learning on Codedex. I'm also using ChatGPT to help answer questions that I have, such as 'Why do I need to use std:: to declare a string variable but not a double?'. I find its a good tool when self learning because you can just ask it the stupidest questions and you get a quick answer. I know using AI is a touchy subject but its not going anywhere so better to get on board then get let behind.

After 12 months of not coding a single line of code, I thought it would be fun to dust of my skills and dive into a completely new language C++. Although I think about working in fintech the most, working in gaming is something that has always been at the back of my mind. Imagine playing GTA and being able to say 'I coded that handbag you just stole off that Grandma'

I've decided to turn one of my favourite book series into a game, using the old-school Pokémon game as inspiration, like below. The reason for this is:

<li>Pokemon is ICONIC</li>
<li>I will be able to find graphics easily online, instead of spending 2 weeks drawing a tree and not coding</li>
<li>I assume there will be a lot of online resources to help me on my journey</li>
  <br>

<h3>To do list:</h3>

<ol>Scope out project: Write a brief 'script' of what the game will look like</ol>
<ol>Learn some basic C++: I have started a codedex course just to compare to other languages I know</ol>
<ol>Look into how C++ integrates with 2D game framework or multimedia libraries</ol>

<h3>Scope/Script</h3>

Long-term goal one is to build the first level of the game.

Intro: Small room, Carl playing CoD, sleeping Donut (cat). Text appears, prompting the player to locate Carl's smokes. The player can walk around the room until they find it, interacting with other objects.
Once the cigarette is lit, the room fills with smoke. The player must quickly open the window, timed. Once the window opens, Donut jumps out into tree. Have to dress Carl for the cold, pink crocs and coat, walk down the stairs inside the apartment ( or maybe just a lazy out one door and automatically outside.
Then, when outside, something like the apple catcher game, Carl tries to coax Donut out of the tree, and branches fall, which he must avoid. After avoiding x amount of branches, Ms Parsons yells at him, the world collapses, and the dungeon appears. Carl and Donut enter > Level Two.

Step one:

Build inital background and make Carl be able to walk around it.
