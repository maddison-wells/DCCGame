# DCCGame
C++ game based on the Dungeon Crawler Carl Series by Matt Dinniman

<h2>9th July 2025</h2>

After 12 months of not coding a single line of code, I thought it would be fun to dust of my skills and dive into a completely new language C++. Although I think about working in fintech the most, working in gaming is something that has always been at the back of my mind. Imagine playing GTA and being able to say 'I coded that handbag you just stole off that Grandma' 

I've decided to turn one of my favourite book series into a game, using the old-school Pok√©mon game as inspiration, like below. The reason for this is: 
<li>Pokemon is ICONIC</li>
<li>I will be able to find graphics easily online, instead of spending 2 weeks drawing a tree and not coding</li>
<li>I assume there will be a lot of online resources to help me on my journey</li>
  <br>


<h3>To do list:</h3>

<ol>Scope out project: Write a brief 'script' of what the game will look like</ol>
<ol>Learn some basic C++: I have started a codedex course just to compare to other languages I know</ol>
<ol>Look into how C++ integrates with 2D game framework or multimedia libraries</ol>
